  <h1>Hi, I'm Zahraa Almayyahi.</h1>

  <p>I hold a PMP and use Lean Six Sigma methods in my work and daily life. I enjoy solving problems and improving
    systems. I stay curious and push myself to learn more. I use structured steps, clear goals, and continuous
    improvement to guide my decisions. I work through challenges with persistence and a steady approach. I bring strong
    organization, clear thinking, and a drive to grow in every area of my work.</p>

  <h2>Explore all my projects in one place.</h2>

  <p>These are the work examples I've put together as reference material for my web, app, and ux/ui courses at Central
    Washington University.</p>
