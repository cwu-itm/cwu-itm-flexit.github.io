        <h2>Systems Thinking: A Bigger Picture</h2>

        <p>
          Systems thinking is one of those ideas that seem obvious in retrospect. Yet, the deeper you go, 
          the more it changes how you see everything—projects, organizations, technologies, and even people.
          After reading the first chapters of <em>Systems Engineering Demystified</em>, I realized systems thinking
          is all about seeing relationships instead of isolated problems.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rather than hyper-focusing on a single issue, systems thinking encourages us to zoom out and 
          view how all parts interact (Holt, 2021). In project management, this insight is incredibly useful —
          one decision can ripple through an entire system.
        </p>

        <h2>Seeing the Whole System</h2>

        <p>
          Systems are made up of components, stakeholders, constraints, and boundaries. What matters most 
          isn’t just the components - but how they connect and evolve over time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Holt’s “Three Evils of Systems Engineering” complexity, communication, and understanding—
          show us that most failures occur when we ignore the relationships or miscommunicate context. 
          Stakeholders often interpret requirements differently. Systems thinking helps us unify perspectives.
        </p>

        <h2>Systems Thinking vs. Linear Thinking</h2>

        <p>
          Linear thinking works well for simple, predictable tasks (A ➝ B ➝ C), but real-world systems are rarely linear.
          They involve loops, feedback, external forces, and dynamic change. MIT Sloan highlights this challenge
          in its research on dynamic systems (MIT Sloan, n.d.).
        </p>

        <p>Systems thinking asks deeper questions, such as:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>What else will this decision affect?</li>
          <li>Who is impacted by this change?</li>
          <li>What happens if this part fails?</li>
          <li>Are there hidden constraints or delays?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          For example, the reading compares a 1970s car to a modern one. Both serve the same purpose (transportation),
          but today's cars rely on digital systems, GPS, sensors, and more. That complexity requires systems-level awareness.
        </p>

        <h2>Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)</h2>

        <p>
          MBSE takes systems thinking even further by creating a shared model that acts as the source of truth for all design decisions.
          Instead of working from scattered documents, teams collaborate from a central system model (Holt, 2021).
        </p>

        <p>
          According to INCOSE (2023), MBSE improves collaboration, minimizes miscommunication, and supports complex systems through
          consistent, model-driven design.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>The model captures only what’s essential it’s not everything.</li>
          <li>Different stakeholders can view what matters most to them.</li>
          <li>SysML helps keep everyone on the same page.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My Reflection</h2>

        <p>
          I’ve used systems thinking without knowing it had a name. In real projects, I often consider risks, effects, and stakeholders 
          before making decisions. Systems thinking gives language and structure to what I was already doing.
        </p>

        <p>
          MBSE also feels relevant especially in environments where requirements and expectations shift quickly. 
          It's clear why this approach is gaining traction across industries.
        </p>

        <p>
          In short, systems thinking and MBSE are more than methods, they’re mindsets. And in a world of growing complexity,
          they are essential to understanding the big picture.
