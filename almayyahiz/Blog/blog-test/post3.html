          <h1>Module 3.1 How Interface Logic Shapes the Way We Think, Notice, and Act</h1>
        </div>

        <p>
          Digital interfaces guide behavior, shape interpretation, and influence how users take action. 
          Layout, affordances, visual hierarchy, and feedback all affect how people understand a system and 
          what actions they take next. This reflection draws on ideas from 
          <em>Designing with the Mind in Mind</em> and <em>Laws of UX</em> to evaluate how interface logic either 
          supports or disrupts usability. I also compare real examples, both effective and frustrating, to show how 
          design choices impact clarity and user confidence.
        </p>

        <p>
          Three UX laws frame this analysis, the Aesthetic Usability Effect, the Von Restorff Effect, and Postel’s Law. 
          Each highlights patterns in how people perceive and process information. When interfaces align with these 
          mental models, users navigate smoothly. When they do not, hesitation and errors increase.
        </p>

        <h3>How Interface Layout Shapes User Behavior</h3>

        <p>
          Layout guides attention. Users follow predictable scanning patterns and depend on visual hierarchy to decide 
          what matters. Johnson (2020) notes that people interpret interfaces through cognitive shortcuts and 
          perceptual cues. When grouping, alignment, and contrast are intentional, users understand the structure 
          without added effort.
        </p>

        <p>
          Clear layout reduces cognitive load. It highlights primary actions, separates content meaningfully, and 
          reinforces relationships between elements. Good layout lets users focus on tasks instead of searching for information.

        <h3>The Aesthetic Usability Effect</h3>

        <p>
          The Aesthetic Usability Effect suggests that users judge attractive interfaces as easier to use 
          (Laws of UX, n.d.). Clean spacing, cohesive colors, and modern typography influence how reliable and 
          intuitive a system feels. Johnson (2020) explains that aesthetic clarity lowers perceived cognitive effort, 
          making tasks feel smoother and more supported.
        </p>

        <h3>The Von Restorff Effect: What Stands Out Gets Attention</h3>

        <p>
          The Von Restorff Effect states that items that differ from their surroundings stand out and are easier to 
          remember. This principle is essential for calls to action, warnings, or next steps. When everything looks 
          uniform, users hesitate. When key actions are visually distinct, navigation feels direct and confident.

        <h3>Postel’s Law: Be Flexible with Input, Clear with Output</h3>

        <p>
          Postel’s Law encourages systems to accept flexible inputs while returning predictable, clean outputs. 
          It applies to search fields, forms, and login experiences. Interfaces that accept natural user variations 
          punctuation, spacing, capitalization reduce friction and support natural behavior.
        </p>

        <p>
          When systems reject inputs for small errors or provide unhelpful feedback, users experience unnecessary frustration. 
          Postel’s Law promotes designs that guide users gently rather than punishing minor mistakes.
        </p>

        <h3>A Positive Example of Good Interface Logic</h3>

        <p>
          The Headspace app demonstrates strong interface logic. Navigation patterns are predictable, spacing is balanced, 
          and visual cues support calm decision making. The design leverages the Aesthetic Usability Effect to build an 
          environment that feels focused and reassuring.
        </p>

        <h3>A Poor Example of Interface Logic</h3>

        <p>
          A government scheduling portal I used illustrates the cost of poor design. Required fields were visually unclear, 
          error messages lacked context, and strict formatting rules created friction. These issues conflicted with the 
          Von Restorff Effect and Postel’s Law, resulting in repeated user errors.

        <h3>Why Interface Logic Matters</h3>

        <p>
          Strong interface logic reduces mental effort and increases user confidence. Poor structure causes hesitation, 
          mistakes, and unnecessary frustration. Applying design laws such as the Aesthetic Usability Effect, the 
          Von Restorff Effect, and Postel’s Law supports intuitive, predictable user experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
          The goal of design is alignment with human thinking. Interfaces should adapt to users, not force users to adapt 
          to confusing systems.
        </p>
